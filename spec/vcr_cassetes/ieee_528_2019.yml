        A format guide for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom dynamically
        tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common ground of terminology
        and practice for manufacturers and users. A compilation of recommended procedures
        for testing a DTG is also given. The requirements and test procedures are
        defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications of the gyro as
        an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to
        two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical
        of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform
        applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected
        are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down
        DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the
        extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More 836-2009 IEEE
        Recommended Practice for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers
        This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
        tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
        The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted
        to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications of the gyro as
        an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to
        two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical
        of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform
        applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected
        are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down
        DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the
        extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More 836-2009 IEEE
        Recommended Practice for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers
        This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
        tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
        The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted
        to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        describes the conduct and analysis of precision tests that are to be performed
        on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques. The term \u201cprecision,\u201d
        in this context, refers to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer
        parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish environmental survivability
        only. Evaluation may take the form of determining the coefficients of the
        accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are
        most accurately determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively,
        evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer output complies with
        specific error limit criteria. Sponsor Committee AES\/GA - Gyro Accelerometer

        an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to
        two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical
        of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform
        applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected
        are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down
        DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the
        extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform
        applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected
        are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down
        DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the
        extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More 836-2009 IEEE
        Recommended Practice for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers
        This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
        tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
        The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted
        to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        Dynamically Tuned Gyros A format guide for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom
        dynamically tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common
        ground of terminology and practice for manufacturers and users. A compilation
        of recommended procedures for testing a DTG is also given. The requirements
        and test procedures are defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications
        of the gyro as an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems.
        They apply to two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments
        typical of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed
        platform applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro
        is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of
        the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are

        A format guide for the preparation of a two-degree-of-freedom dynamically
        tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common ground of terminology
        and practice for manufacturers and users. A compilation of recommended procedures

        defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications of the gyro as
        an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems. They apply to
        two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments typical
        of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed platform
        applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro is subjected
        are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of the strap-down
        DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are considered to the
        extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More 836-2009 IEEE
        Recommended Practice for Precision Centrifuge Testing of Linear Accelerometers
        This recommended practice describes the conduct and analysis of precision
        tests that are to be performed on linear accelerometers using centrifuge techniques.
        The term u201cprecision,u201d in this context, refers to tests that are conducted
        to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed to those conducted to establish
        environmental survivability only. Evaluation may take the form of determining
        the coefficients of the accelerometer''s model equation, except for bias and
        scale factor, which are most accurately determined by static multi-position
        tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only establish that the accelerometer
        output complies with specific error limit criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter

        dynamically tuned gyro (DTG) specification is given that provides a common

        and test procedures are defined in terms unique to the DTG. They cover applications
        of the gyro as an angular motion sensor in navigation and control systems.
        They apply to two modes of use: (1) as a strap-down sensor in operating environments
        typical of aircraft and missile applications, and (2) as a sensor in gimballed
        platform applications in which the dynamic angular inputs to which the gyro
        is subjected are benign relative to the accuracy required. In the case of
        the strap-down DTG, the characteristics of the external capture loops are
        considered to the extent necessary to define the gyro performance. Learn More

        to tests that are conducted to evaluate accelerometer parameters, as opposed
        to those conducted to establish environmental survivability only. Evaluation
        may take the form of determining the coefficients of the accelerometer''s
        model equation, except for bias and scale factor, which are most accurately
        determined by static multi-position tests. Alternatively, evaluation may only
        establish that the accelerometer output complies with specific error limit
        criteria. Learn More Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Instagram YouTube IEEE SA About
