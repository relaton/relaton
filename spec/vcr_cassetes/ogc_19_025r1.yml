        Notation (JSON) [NR1] has been gaining in popularity for encoding data in
        Web-based applications. JSON consists of sets of objects described by name\/value
        pairs. GeoJSON [NR2] is a format for encoding collections of simple geographical
        features along with their non-spatial attributes using JSON. This OGC Best
        Practice describes a GeoJSON [NR2] and JSON-LD [NR13] encoding for Earth Observation
        (EO) metadata for collections (dataset series). This standard can be applied
        to encode metadata based on the OGC 11-035r1 [OR20] or ISO19139 [OR27], ISO19139-2
        [OR28] specifications, or as an encoding of the Unified Metadata Model for
        Collections (UMM-C) conceptual model [OR2].\r\n\r\nThe GeoJSON encoding defined
        in this document is defined as a compaction1 through a normative context,
        of the proposed JSON-LD encoding, with some extensions as presented in section
        8 of this document. Therefore, the JSON-LD encoding can also be applied to
        other RDF [OR8] encodings including RDF\/XML [OR11] and RDF Turtle [OR12].\r\n\r\nThis
        document makes no assumptions as to the \u201cservice\u201d interfaces through
        which the metadata are accessed and applies equally well to a Service Oriented
        Architecture as well as a Resource Oriented or RESTful Architecture.\r\n\r\nGeoJSON
        is a format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along
        with their non-spatial attributes using JSON. GeoJSON objects may represent
        a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features. GeoJSON supports the following
        geometry types derived from the OGC Simple Features specification: Point,
        LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.
        Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and
        a feature collection represents a list of features.\r\n\r\nJSON is human readable
        and easily parseable. However, JSON is schemaless. JSON and GeoJSON documents
        do not include an explicit definition of the structure of the JSON objects
        contained in them. Therefore, this standard is based on a normative JSON-LD
        context which allows each property to be explicitly defined as a URI. Furthermore,
        the JSON encoding is defined using JSON Schema [OR7] which allows validation
        of instances against these schemas.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2021-04-21","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"8":{"title":"Joint

        of that state, as well as future opportunities for an improved state. That
        report describes a number of candidate models for UGII and recommends a number
        of follow-on activities, including development of a prototype UGII integration
        model to support subsequent UGII integration and exchange initiatives. A follow-up
        workshop and model development effort resulted in another engineering report
        describing an initial (1.0) version of the conceptual UGII integration model
        MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition and Interchange) [2]. The present
        updated report describes MUDDI version 1.1. The goal of MUDDI is to serve
        as the basis for integration of datasets from different models, at the levels
        of detail required to address application use cases described in [1]. MUDDI
        as described here is a conceptual model which will serve as the basis for
        one or more conformant and interchangeable logical and physical implementations
        such as GML (Geographic Markup Language) or SFS (Simple Features SQL). The
        current version 1.1 of MUDDI has been updated and refined from the initial
        version 1.0, but is still intended to serve as an input to the proposed OGC
        Underground Infrastructure Pilot as well as similar implementations and deployments
        in realistic application scenarios. The present model is also suitable as
        input to begin development of a formal conceptual model standard.","publisher":"Open

        describes the work performed in the Machine Learning Thread of OGC\u2019s
        Testbed-16 initiative.\r\n\r\nPrevious OGC testbed tasks concerned with Machine
        Learning (ML) concentrated on the methods and apparatus of training models
        to produce high quality results. The work reported in this ER, however, focuses
        less on the accuracy of machine models and more on how the entire machine
        learning processing chain from discovering training data to visualizing the
        results of a ML model run can be integrated into a standards-based data infrastructure
        specifically based on OGC interface standards.\r\n\r\nThe work performed in
        this thread consisted of:\r\n\r\nTraining ML models;\r\n\r\nDeploying trained
        ML models;\r\n\r\nMaking deployed ML models discoverable;\r\n\r\nExecuting
        an ML model;\r\n\r\nPublishing the results from executing a ML model;\r\n\r\nVisualizing
        the results from running a ML model.\r\n\r\nAt each step, the following OGC
        and related standards were integrated into the workflow to provide an infrastructure
        upon which the above activities were performed:\r\n\r\nOGC API - Features:
        Approved OGC Standard that provides API building blocks to create, retrieve,
        modify and query features on the Web.\r\n\r\nOGC API - Coverages: Draft OGC
        Standard that provides API building blocks to create, retrieve, modify and
        query coverages on the Web.\r\n\r\nOGC API - Records: Draft OGC Standard that
        provides API building block to create, modify and query catalogues on the
        Web.\r\n\r\nApplication Deployment and Execution Service: Draft OGC Standard
        that provides API building blocks to deploy, execute and retrieve results
        of processes on the Web.\r\n\r\nMapML is a specification that was published
        by the Maps For HTML Community Group. It extends the base HTML map element
        to handle the display and editing of interactive geographic maps and map data
        without the need of special plugins or JavaScript libraries. The Design of
        MapML resolves a Web Platform gap by combining map and map data semantics
        into a hypermedia format that is syntactically and architecturally compatible
        with and derived from HTML. It provides a standardized way for declarative
        HTML content to communicate with custom spatial server software (which currently
        use HTTP APIs based on multiple queries and responses). It allows map and
        map data semantics to be either included in HTML directly, or referred to
        at arbitrary URLs that describe stand-alone layers of map content, including
        hyper-linked annotations to further content.\r\n\r\nParticular emphasis was
        placed on using services based on the emerging OGC API Framework suite of
        API building blocks.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2021-02-15","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"38":{"title":"Built

        Echterhoff","contributor":null,"description":"During UGAS-2020 emerging technology
        requirements for NAS employment in the NSG, and with general applicability
        for the wider geospatial community, were investigated and solutions developed
        in four areas.\r\n\r\nTo enable a wide variety of analytic tradecrafts in
        the NSG to consistently and interoperably exchange data, the NAS defines an
        NSG-wide standard UML-based application schema in accordance with the ISO
        19109 General Feature Model. In light of continuing technology evolution in
        the commercial marketplace it is desirable to be able to employ (NAS-conformant)
        JSON-based data exchanges alongside existing (NAS-conformant) XML-based data
        exchanges. A prototype design and implementation of UML Application Schema
        to JSON Schema rules (see the OWS-9 SSI UGAS Conversion Engineering Report)
        was reviewed and revised based on the final draft IETF JSON Schema standard
        \u201cdraft 2019-09.\u201d The revised implementation was evaluated using
        NAS Baseline X-3. This work is reported in section UML to JSON Schema Encoding
        Rule.\r\n\r\nTo maximize cross-community data interoperability the NAS employs
        conceptual data schemas developed by communities external to the NSG, for
        example as defined by the ISO 19100-series standards. At the present time
        there are no defined JSON-based encodings for those conceptual schemas. A
        JSON-based core profile was developed for key external community conceptual
        schemas, particularly components of those ISO 19100-series standards used
        to enable data discovery, access, control, and use in data exchange in general,
        including in the NSG. This work is reported in section Features Core Profile
        of Key Community Conceptual Schemas.\r\n\r\nThe Features Core Profile and
        its JSON encoding have been specified with a broader scope than the NAS. It
        builds on the widely used GeoJSON standard and extends it with minimal extensions
        to support additional concepts that are important for the wider geospatial
        community and the OGC API standards, including support for solids, coordinate
        reference systems, and time intervals. These extensions have been kept minimal
        to keep implementation efforts as low as possible. If there is interest in
        the OGC membership, the JSON encoding of the Core Profile could be a starting
        point for a JSON encoding standard for features in the OGC. A new Standards
        Working Group for a standard OGC Features and Geometries JSON has been proposed.\r\n\r\nLinked
        data is increasingly important in enabling \u201cconnect the dots\u201d correlation
        and alignment among diverse, distributed data sources and data repositories.
        Validation of both data content and link-based data relationships is critical
        to ensuring that the resulting virtual data assemblage has logical integrity
        and thus constitutes meaningful information. SHACL, a language for describing
        and validating RDF graphs, appears to offer significant as yet unrealized
        potential for enabling robust data validation in a linked-data environment.
        The results of evaluating that potential \u2013 with emphasis on deriving
        SHACL from a UML-based application schema - are reported in section Using
        SHACL for Validation of Linked Data.\r\n\r\nThe OpenAPI initiative is gaining
        traction in the commercial marketplace as a next-generation approach to defining
        machine-readable specifications for RESTful APIs in web-based environments.
        The OGC is currently shifting towards interface specifications based on the
        OpenAPI 3.1 specification. That specification defines both the interface (interactions
        between the client and service) and the structure of data payloads (content)
        offered by that service. It is desirable to be able to efficiently model the
        service interface using UML and then automatically derive the physical expression
        of that interface (for example, as a JSON file) using Model Driven Engineering
        (MDE) techniques alongside the derivation of JSON Schema defining data content.
        A preliminary analysis and design based on the OGC API Features standard,
        parts 1 and 2, for sections other than for content schemas, is reported in
        section Generating OpenAPI definitions from an application schema in UML.\r\n\r\nAll
        ShapeChange enhancements developed within the UGAS-2020 Pilot have been publicly
        released as a component of ShapeChange v2.10.0. https:\/\/shapechange.net

        included implementations of the OGC API \u2013 Features standard and the draft
        OGC API \u2013 Tiles specification. The feature and tile servers provided
        support for a variety of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS). This ER provides
        an overview of each of the components, their implementation decisions and
        the challenges faced.\r\n\r\nThe VTP2 participants intend to use the results
        of the work in VTP2 to inform the development of OGC APIs, GeoPackage, and
        web service standards to enable consistent use both online and offline, particularly
        in DDIL environments. Such consistent use of tiled feature data online and
        offline will improve interoperability and usability of geospatial applications.
        Therefore, the value of the VTP2 work to organizations is expected to be in
        the efficiencies and productivity that comes from greater interoperability
        and usability.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2020-07-07","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"100":{"title":"OGC

        OpenSearch specification [NR3] is defined as a binding of the Abstract Protocol
        Definition (APD) for the searchRetrieve operation, one of a set of documents
        [NR4] for the OASIS Search Web Services (SWS) initiative [OR1]. The OpenSearch
        Description Document (OSDD) allows clients to retrieve service metadata from
        an OpenSearch implementation. The OSDD format allows the use of extensions
        that allow search engines to inform clients about specific and contextual
        query parameters and response formats. The OpenSearch extension for Earth
        Observation (EO) collections and products search is defined in [OR20]. The
        mandatory response format is based on Atom 1.0\/XML [OR14].\r\n\r\nJavaScript
        Object Notation (JSON) [NR1] has been gaining in popularity for encoding data
        in Web-based applications. JSON consists of sets of objects described by name\/value
        pairs.  GeoJSON [NR2] is a format for encoding collections of simple geographical
        features along with their non-spatial attributes using JSON. This OGC standard
        describes a GeoJSON [NR2] and JSON-LD [NR15] encoding for OpenSearch Response
        documents.\r\n\r\nThe GeoJSON encoding defined in this document is defined
        as a compaction[1] through a normative context, of the proposed JSON-LD encoding,
        with some extensions as presented in section 8 of this document.  Therefore,
        the JSON-LD encoding can also be applied to other RDF [OR8] encodings including
        RDF\/XML [OR11] and RDF Turtle [OR12].\r\n\r\nAlthough this document makes
        no assumptions as to the \u201cservice\u201d interfaces through which the
        Search Response is obtained and applies equally well to a Service Oriented
        Architecture as well as a Resource Oriented or RESTful architecture.  The
        documented approach is mainly intended to be applied in combination with the
        following technologies:\r\n\r\nOGC OpenSearch extensions [OR19], [OR20], [NR3].\r\nGeoJSON
        is a format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along
        with their non-spatial attributes using JSON. GeoJSON objects may represent
        a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features. GeoJSON supports the following
        geometry types derived from the OGC Simple Features specification: Point,
        LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon and GeometryCollection.
        Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and
        a feature collection represents a list of features.\r\n\r\nJSON is human readable
        and easily parseable. However, JSON is schemaless.  JSON and GeoJSON documents
        do not include an explicit definition of the structure of the JSON objects
        contained in them.  Therefore, this standard is based on a normative JSON-LD
        context which allows each property to be explicitly defined as a URI.  Furthermore,
        the JSON encoding is defined using JSON Schema [OR24] which allows validation
        of instances against these schemas.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2020-04-27","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"124":{"title":"An

        effort to develop Application Programming Interface (API) standards that support
        the Resource Oriented Architecture and make use of the OpenAPI specification.
        As part of this effort, this OGC Testbed 15 Engineering Report (ER) defines
        a proof-of-concept of an API specification for maps and tiles.\r\n\r\nThe
        OGC API Maps and Tiles draft specification described in this ER builds on
        the precedent of the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core standard. The OGC API
        - Tiles draft specification describes a service that retrieves data representations
        as tiles, which are generally small compared with the geographic extent of
        the data. In the draft specification, the assumption is that tiles are organized
        into Tile Matrix Sets consisting of regular tile matrices available at different
        scales or resolutions. The OGC API \u2013 Tiles draft specification is described
        as a building block that can be plugged into an OGC API - Features service
        to retrieve tiled feature data (sometimes called vector tiles) or to an OGC
        API \u2013 Maps implementation to retrieve rendered tiles (sometimes called
        map tiles). In the future, the OGC API - Tiles draft specification could extend
        other specifications, one possible candidate being the emerging OGC API \u2013
        Coverages draft specification.\r\n\r\nThe OGC API - Maps draft specification
        describes an API that presents data as maps by applying a style. These maps
        can be retrieved in a tiled structure (if OGC API - Tiles is approved as an
        OGC Implementation Standard) or as maps of any size generated on-the-fly.
        The OGC API - Maps draft specification implements some functionality, specified
        in the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) 1.0 standard, related to the use of styles
        by using the Styles API draft specification that was developed in the Testbed-15
        Open Portrayal Framework thread.\r\n\r\nThe draft Maps and Tiles API specifications
        are designed in a modular way. With the exception of the core requirements,
        the other conformance classes describe functionality that can be considered
        optional characteristics that can be combined by server implementations at
        will.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Testbed-15, the original proposed title for
        this ER was OGC Testbed-15: Web Map Tiling Service Draft Specification Engineering
        Report but in the course of the Testbed-15 that title was changed to better
        represent the content.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2020-01-08","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"140":{"title":"OGC

        Changeset draft specification addresses the use case of an OGC API tile server
        that serves image tiles and a client that portrays the result as a set of
        images. The tile server uses a set of images (e.g. a set of remote sensing
        satellite scenes or a set of drone pictures) in the backend and they are also
        accessible by an API - Images. The source images can be updated and therefore
        the tile server also needs to be able to deliver only the tiles that have
        changed. The draft specification is divided into two independent parts that
        can be used in broader scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe OGC API \u2013 Images: Enables
        managing (retrieving, creating and updating) sets of images that are georeferenced.
        The images does not follow any tile scheme, and can partiallyor totally overlap.
        The API enables a mosaicking use case (where the imagery is combined in a
        single bigger \u201cpicture\u201d) but could also serve a use case in which
        a moving camera is taking pictures at locations along a route and then stores
        the images as a single collection.\r\n\r\nThe Changeset filter: Enables filtering
        a request to a data service in a way that only recent changes are delivered.
        It can be applied to OGC API that provide access to data and in particular
        to the OGC API tiles.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2020-01-08","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"141":{"title":"OGC

        (OGC) GeoPackage Encoding Standard was developed for the purpose of providing
        an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing,
        compact format for transferring geospatial information. GeoPackage has proven
        to be an effective container mechanism for bundling and sharing geospatial
        data for a variety of operational use cases. However, GeoPackage stakeholders
        have observed persistent interoperability issues, particularly with regards
        to metadata, extensions, and portrayal.\r\n\r\nThis paper presents the operational
        need, proposed approach, and way ahead for addressing these interoperability
        issues. Section 6 presents three new enhancements (extensions) that are designed
        to improve the interoperability of GeoPackages in general and metadata in
        particular. Section 7 presents a vision for implementing an Open Portrayal
        Framework in GeoPackage. Annex A presents specifications for all of the GeoPackage
        extensions proposed in this paper. Annex B presents a JSON schema for the
        proposed encoding for application profiles presented in Section 6. In general,
        the GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) looks to standardize extensions
        that address a clear use case, have a sound technical approach, and have a
        commitment to implementation by multiple organizations. As with the GeoPackage
        Tiled Gridded Coverage Extension and the GeoPackage Related Tables Extension,
        these new extensions would be tracked as separate documents from the core
        GeoPackage Encoding Standard.\r\n\r\nThe GeoPackage community will benefit
        from the increased interoperability of operational \u201cmission-ready\u201d
        GeoPackages that will result from this approach. Additionally, software will
        be able to quickly determine the validity and utility of a GeoPackage in target
        operational environments. This will help ensure that GeoPackage production-consumption
        lifecycles and supporting application tools and services are better aligned
        with stakeholder missions.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2019-11-25","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"153":{"title":"OGC

        Pilot Initiative was sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division. This
        initiative addressed key challenges related to indoor mapping and navigation
        for the purpose of supporting first responders in fields such as fire-fighting.
        The focus of this initiative was on developing the capabilities and workflows
        required for pre-planning operations. This included scanning each building
        to produce a point cloud dataset and converting this source data into various
        intermediate forms to support the generation of indoor navigation routes.
        This Engineering Report (ER) describes the work conducted in this initiative,
        the lessons learned captured by participants, and future recommendations to
        support the public safety efforts and interoperability of the standards. It
        is expected that future OGC initiatives will address the real-time, event-driven
        aspects of indoor mapping and navigation for first response situations.\r\n\r\nFirst
        responders typically survey high-risk facilities in their jurisdiction at
        least once per year as part of a pre-planning process. Pre-planning outputs
        are often in the form of reports, and first responders may generate their
        own hand-drawn maps during the process or annotate available floor plans (e.g.,
        from computer-aided design models). Pre-planning is time-consuming, inefficient,
        and inherently complex considering the information and level of detail that
        should or could be captured, the lack of automation, and the difficulty identifying
        notable changes to facilities and infrastructure during successive pre-planning
        surveys.\r\n\r\nMobile three-dimensional (3D) Light Detection and Ranging
        (LiDAR) has been identified as a potentially transformational technology for
        first responders. Using LiDAR and 360-degree camera imagery, coupled with
        advanced software processing, first responders could efficiently capture 3D
        point clouds and a wealth of other information, both observed and derived,
        while walking through buildings as part of routine pre-planning operations.
        The use of 3D LiDAR and imagery has many potential upsides beyond just creating
        point clouds for visualization and mapping (e.g., use in localization, object
        classification, integration with virtual\/augmented reality solutions, change
        detection, etc.).","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2019-10-23","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"161":{"title":"OGC

        Engineering Report (ER) describes the results of the Augmented Reality (AR)
        work performed in the Testbed-14 CityGML and Augmented Reality work package
        which was part of the Next Generation Services thread.\r\n\r\nBy integrating
        information available from urban models within a view of the real world through
        a mobile device, this testbed activity explored the possibilities offered
        by AR in a geospatial context. The ER additionally discusses the approach
        used to bring in these urban models from various data sources. The experiments
        also covered to some extent Virtual Reality (VR) where any city can be explored
        freely from a computer display or potentially within a VR headset.\r\n\r\nA
        continuation of these experiments would have looked at a combination of Augmented
        and Virtual Reality (Mixed Reality). The portrayal of AR and three-dimensional
        (3D) content through extending a common conceptual model to style classic
        geospatial features (as explored in the Testbed-14 Portrayal work) is also
        touched upon. The efficient transmission of 3D content is also a subject of
        this document through the use of a simple 3D transmission format developed
        during the initiative.\r\n\r\nThis ER provides many insights that showcase
        what is now made possible by the combination of AR, VR and integrated urban
        models.\r\n\r\nThe testbed work shines light on the benefits of applying a
        common portrayal approach to AR, bridging the gap between AR applications
        and traditional Geographic Information Systems and services.\r\n\r\nThe ER
        introduces a new, simple approach and conceptual model for transmitting 3D
        geospatial content which could be the basis to define simple profiles for
        the I3S and 3D Tiles community standards. It could also inform enhancements
        to the 3D Portrayal Service (3DPS) and\/or next generation services (e.g.,
        WFS 3.0) for delivering 3D contents in a format agnostic manner.\r\n\r\nFinally,
        the ER covers methods to bring in different types of geospatial content from
        various sources for integration into AR applications.\r\n\r\nDuring Testbed-14,
        the participants demonstrated AR experiences with geospatial datasets providing
        integrated views of urban spaces. Two clients and two services were shown
        to be interoperable, streaming AR content through a simple 3D transmission
        format, leveraging either GeoJSON or GNOSIS Map Tiles, as well as E3D 3D model
        specifications.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of extending a classic portrayal conceptual
        model for AR was also shown. In order to serve them to the clients in the
        supported transmission formats, geospatial data sets of various types and
        in various formats were successfully imported for consumption by the services.","publisher":"Open

        supports the OpenAPI specification, and modularizes WFS into building blocks
        for fine-grained access to spatial data that can be used by an Application
        Programming Interface (API) for data.\r\n\r\nThis document reviews the work
        that proposes a next generation of OGC web services (NextGen services or Next
        Generation APIs) from the perspective of supporting complex three-dimensional
        (3D) data or complex data schemas. The goal is to identify the best service
        solution for these particular needs, whether the results are WFS 3.0 extensions
        or other approaches. In this context the approach of the NextGen services
        is not of monolithic web services, but Web API building blocks. This is an
        important point. The same API should be able to support requirements that
        currently require separate OGC web services, e.g. a WFS and a 3D Portrayal
        Service (3DPS).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this work is not to preempt other next-generation

        The proposals are based on existing requirements and use cases as well as
        existing support for developers to simplify implementation.\r\n\r\nThe work
        has found no general issues with migrating current WFS, 3DPS, Web Map Tile
        Service (WMTS) and Web Map Service (WMS) capabilities to the NextGen architecture.

        feature info requests in the other standards).","publisher":"Open Geospatial

        Meek","contributor":null,"description":"This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides
        the summary findings resulting from completion of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot
        (VTP or Pilot). The requirements for the Pilot were generated from a combination
        of sponsor input and analysis of typical use cases for tiling of vector feature
        data across the OGC Standards Baseline and related standards. The driving
        use case for this activity was the visualization of feature data on a client.
        The three main scenarios considered were consumption of tiled feature data
        by a web client, a desktop client and a mobile client. As a standards body,
        the OGC already has standards that fit these use cases. These are; Web Map
        Tile Service 1.0 (WMTS) for a web client, and GeoPackage 1.2 for a mobile
        client. Web Feature Service (WFS) 3.0 is suitable for a desktop client and
        has an in-built method to support tiling, but not specifically for tiled feature
        data such as that explored in the VTP. One of the purposes of the Pilot was
        to produce demonstration implementations to support tiled feature data using
        WFS 3.0, WMTS 1.0 and GeoPackage 1.2 that can be validated by Technology Integration
        Experiments (TIEs). The draft extension to these standards helped define a
        draft Conceptual Model for tiled feature data in support of visualization.
        The Conceptual Model formally captures the requirements for component implementations
        and rationalizes them into a model documented in the Unified Modeling Language
        (UML).\r\n\r\nThe ER provides an overview of each of the components, their
        implementation decisions and the challenges faced. The components are presented
        as draft extensions to existing standards. The WFS standard is currently in
        a major revision cycle and is transitioning away from services to a resource-oriented
        architecture. This transition has implications for access to tiled feature
        data. This offers options of access to pre-rendered tiles, or to tiles created
        using WFS 3.0 query functionality. The current WMTS standard only offers access
        to the pre-rendered tiles and much of the work is therefore about defining
        and supporting tiled feature data as a media type. The OGC GeoPackage standard
        is more complex as it attempts to ship all of the tiled feature data in a
        self-contained package aimed at environments that have Denied, Degraded, Intermittent
        or Limited (DDIL) bandwidth. DDIL is an important use case for GeoPackage
        as most normal web services do not function without connectivity. The military,
        first responders and other groups who work in challenging operational environments
        require a capability to ship, store and distribute geospatial data in an efficient,
        modern manner. The combination of GeoPackage and tiled feature data offers
        the means to supply detailed geospatial data in a portable fashion to satisfy
        many DDIL use cases. GeoPackage also offers the majority of the future work
        as it attempts to store information such as styling and attribution separately
        to the geometries to take advantage of a relational database structure.\r\n\r\nWhen
        this project was initiated, the term vector tiles was used throughout. However,
        as the project progressed, the participants agreed that the term tiled feature
        data was more appropriate than the colloquial term of vector tiles. This engineering
        report therefore interchangeably uses both tiled feature data and vector tiles
        to refer to the approach of tiling vector feature data.\r\n\r\n","publisher":"Open

        referred to as ''vector tiles'', can be used to optimize the delivery of vector
        data over the web. This data may subsequently be used to support visualization
        (particularly through maps) as well as limited analysis activities. One goal
        of the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot was to define candidate extensions to existing
        OGC standards as a way to advance the use of vector tiles technology as part
        of the OGC baseline. This Engineering Report (ER) describes a set of possible
        extensions to GeoPackage 1.2 that documents the mechanism to store and retrieve
        vector tiles in a GeoPackage. These extensions work together to enable a GeoPackage
        to act as a container format that can support visualization and analysis activities,
        even in a Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, or Limited Bandwidth (DDIL) environment.\r\n\r\nThe
        GeoPackage Vector Tiles extensions define the rules and requirements for encoding
        vector tiles in a GeoPackage data store. There are five draft extensions:\r\n\r\nThe
        Vector Tiles Extension provides vector tiles support through the GeoPackage
        tiles option.\r\n\r\nThe Mapbox Vector Tiles Extension allows the content
        of a tile Binary Large OBject (BLOB) to be a Mapbox Vector Tile as per version
        2.1 of the Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) specification [1].\r\n\r\nThe GeoJSON
        Vector Tiles Extension allows the content of each tile BLOB to be a GeoJSON
        file.\r\n\r\nThe OGC Web Services (OWS) Context Extension provides a way to
        store information describing a list of geospatial resources, including but
        not limited to maps, their layers, and the styles of those layers.\r\n\r\nThe
        Vector Tiles Attributes Extension allows attribute information for each feature
        to be stored in relational tables for more convenient querying.\r\n\r\nTo
        support vector tiles, a minimum of at least two extensions is required. The
        first extension enables vector tiles support. However, to be usable, an encoding
        format must be declared via either the second or third extension. The other
        extensions are purely optional.\r\n\r\nThese extensions, like all GeoPackage
        extensions, are intended to be transparent and to not interfere with GeoPackage-compliant,
        but non-supporting, software packages.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2019-02-15","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"185":{"title":"OGC

        of Experience (QoE) as they are intended and described at the OGC are two
        related concepts which require very specific treatment and characterization.
        Citing the definitions provided by the Domain Working Group (DWG) charter
        document:\r\n\r\nQuality of Service: Technical reliability and performance
        of a network service. Typically measured using metrics like error rates, throughput,
        availability and delay or request response time. This Engineering Report (ER)
        attempts to handle QoS aspects such as service availability, scalability and
        speed.\r\n\r\nQuality of (User) Experience: A holistic, qualitative measure
        of the customers'' experience of the application or service. It encompasses
        both the user experience and the customer support experience of the evaluated
        applications and\/or services.\r\n\r\nQoE focuses on the usability of the
        information that is conceived via OGC services to end users or other client
        application and therefore is concerned more with qualitative aspects of such
        services like presence of metadata, proper and descriptive namings, appropriate
        styling and so on (a more thorough treatment is present in the QoE discussion
        paper OGC 17-049 entitled Ensuring Quality of User Experience with OGC Web
        Mapping Services available at https:\/\/portal.ogc.org\/files\/?artifact_id=74403&version=1).\r\n\r\nQoS
        focuses on providing reliable (i.e. quantitative ) measures of spatial data
        service metrics which can be used to characterize how a service ( one or more
        specific datasets exposed by a certain service) is performing both in near
        real-time as well as historically. It touches concepts like availability,
        scalability (also known as capacity), absolute performance (i.e. speed) and
        can be used to assess also perceived performance by final clients. As mentioned
        above, it is typically measured using metrics like error rates, throughput,
        availability and delay or request response time.\r\n\r\nQuite often the QoS
        and QoE aspects of spatial data services are underestimated if not simply
        ignored due to lack of resources as well as lack of awareness, resulting in
        services which are difficult to exploit (i.e. QoE very low) and\/or unstable
        or very slow (i.e. QoS very low). The result is that few users end up using
        them after the initial launch and this is especially true for services targeting
        end users who are used to interact with services a-la Google Maps which delivers
        extreme performance and scalability as well as bullet-proof usability.\r\n\r\n","publisher":"Open

        together with the existing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) System Wide
        Information Management (SWIM) aviation service registries, the National Airspace
        System Service Registry and Repository (NSRR). This information registry should
        allow the different Air Traffic Management (ATM) stakeholders to retrieve
        the appropriate service registered in the NSRR using the semantic representation
        of real-life entities represented by the data served by the services (e.g.
        estimated departure time, estimated time of arrival, \u201drunway true bearing\u201d\u2026).
        To support the integration of this domain-specific information, the ER proposes
        different strategies based on the semantic annotation proposal made in OGC
        08-167r2 [1] extended with a recent World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation,
        the Web Annotation data model [1]. In particular, the ER focuses on a solution
        using the W3C web annotation data model which adds semantics to the NSRR without
        changing the content of the database. This solution provides a low-cost, flexible
        and efficient alternative to add domain-specific semantics to NSRR content.

        Execution Management Service (EMS). Both the ADES and EMS were identified
        by the European Space Agency (ESA), beforehand, as essential elements of a

        Observation Exploitation Platform ecosystem, populated by TEPs and Mission
        Exploitation Platforms (MEPs), which make use of cloud computing resources
        for Earth Observation data processing, ESA has established two fundamental
        building blocks within a TEP, with different functions, the ADES and the EMS.
        Users interact with a TEP using a Web Client, and the TEP contains a EMS and
        a ADES. The EMS includes most of the control logic, required for deploying
        and executing applications in different MEPs and TEPs, the chaining thereof,
        and the overall coherence of the execution chain (e.g. gathering all outputs
        and enabling their presentation to the user by a client sensibly). The ADES
        instead is responsible for the single application deployment and execution
        on a specific platform. Therefore, it is expected that there are ADES instances

        describes the work performed by the Participants in the Exploitation Platforms
        Earth Observation Clouds (EOC) Thread of OGC Testbed-14 in regard to the Application
        Package (AP).\r\n\r\nThe AP serves as a means to convey different kinds of
        information describing a certain application - often, but not necessarily,
        an Earth Observation data processing algorithm - so that different elements
        of an ecosystem generically known as an Exploitation Platform can exchange
        information among themselves in a standard and interoperable way. The AP guarantees
        that, despite potentially very heterogeneous implementations and implementing
        entities, applications are treated equally. The AP also guarantees that the
        Earth Observation scientist who developed it on the one hand is shielded from
        infrastructure details and heterogeneity and on the other hand benefits from
        the ability to execute the same application on different infrastructure.\r\n\r\nGiven
        its suitability for conveying a Common Operating Picture (COP), in OGC Testbed-13
        the OGC Web Services (OWS) Context standard had been chosen as the basic encoding
        for the Application Package. Despite serious consideration, and while acknowledging
        the advantages of that approach, the consensus among Participants was not
        to continue along this path in Testbed-14 but instead to opt for an AP encoding,
        consisting of a WPS-T (Transactional Web Processing Service (WPS)) DeployProcess
        message encoded in JSON (see Chapter 9 for the rationale). The information
        model conveyed in this manner does not differ significantly from the one that
        could be conveyed using OWS Context, and its main, common features can be
        briefly listed as:\r\n\r\na link to the application execution unit,\r\n\r\na
        description of the application\u2019s inputs and outputs,\r\n\r\nlinks to
        required Earth Observation data catalogues,\r\n\r\nand the possibility to
        pass other auxiliary information.\r\n\r\nAn important difference in Testbed-14
        with respect to Testbed-13 is that the application execution unit is not limited
        to a Docker container, but can also be a workflow described in Common Workflow
        Language (CWL), something which stems directly from one of the Sponsor requirements.
        Finally, it is important to note that this route does not preclude from embedding
        an OWS Context structure in the enclosing DeployProcess document if this is
        desired.\r\n\r\nStarting from the lessons learned and limitations identified
        in Testbed-13, and embracing the new and changed Sponsor requirements, this
        ER explains the trade-offs, decisions and conclusions taken by the Participants
        throughout the project.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2019-02-07","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"197":{"title":"OGC

        discoverability of open geo-data and information is vital to increasing the
        use of these data in- and outside the geospatial expert community. \r\nIn
        this document we start to compare existing metadata standards, e.g., Dublin
        Core, ISO 19115\/57\/19, and INSPIRE, in the geospatial- and open data context.
        We also describe related linked open data initiatives such as RDF, SPARQL,
        and metadata publication initiatives, e.g., schema.org and Atom feeds. GeoDCAT
        is an initiative with the potential to integrate DCAT metadata as they are
        used in the open data and e-government community with EN ISO 19115\/57\/19
        standards and INSPIRE metadata as they are used in the Geospatial community.
        GeoDCAT has - because it is based on RDF- the ability to publish metadata
        directly on the web without open and geospatial data portals.\r\nTo respond
        to the interest of different communities to preserve geospatial metadata resources
        and to support the uptake of GeoDCAT-AP implementations, best practices from
        different countries were identified and studied. The best practice cases focus
        on four domains (focus areas): metadata input (manually or automatically harvested),
        metadata publication into an integrated geo\/open data portal, publication
        of metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD), and information mapping (ISO 19115,
        INSPIRE, DCAT, etc.).\r\nGeoDCAT-AP is a mature solution for mapping metadata
        from the open data and geospatial domain. GeoDCAT helps to integrate and to
        publish metadata in data portals and directly on the world wide web. To conclude
        a GeoDCAT alignment exercise has been done with ISO 19115\/19 and INSPIRE
        to improve the open data and geospatial metadata alignment in the future.\r\n","publisher":"Open

        Platform Hackathon 2018 was conducted to evaluate the standards based architecture
        for deploying and executing arbitrary applications close to the physical location
        of the data in heterogeneous cloud environments. The Hackathon was very successful
        in demonstrating both efficiency and sustainability of the architecture developed
        in Testbed-13. Efficient, because it was possible to setup the full execution
        workflow of 128 Sentinel-1 images within the 1.5 days of the Hackathon in
        a multi-vendor environment. Sustainable, because the architectural approach
        provides sufficient flexibility to cater for possible extensions and exchange
        of cloud & container middleware.\r\n\r\nThe Hackathon produced a number of
        suggestions for future work items. These include new tools to facilitate the
        process of Application Package generation to make it even simpler for scientists
        to bring their applications to the market; a more detailed specification to
        further improve the level of interoperability; and a best practice document
        with lots of examples that illustrate the necessary steps to make applications
        available.\r\n\r\nHackathon participants highlighted that such a level of
        robustness, flexibility, and maturity of the application-to-the-cloud architecture
        has been developed in nine months only during Testbed-13. The participants
        recommend to continue interlacing major OGC Innovation Program activities,
        such as testbeds, with short term rapid prototyping initiatives such as hackathons.
        Almost all participants of the Hackathon had been new to the OGC Innovation
        Program. These participants emphasized that the Hackathon provided an outstanding
        opportunity for newcomers to get quickly familiar with the latest standardization

        (OGC) standard defines the conceptual model for the OGC CDB Standard. The
        objective of this document is to provide an abstract core conceptual model
        for a CDB data store (repository). The model is represented using UML (unified
        modeling language). The conceptual model is comprised of concepts, schema,
        classes and categories as well as their relationships, which are used to understand,
        and\/or represent an OGC CDB data store. This enables a comparison and description
        of the CDB data store structure on a more detailed level. This document was
        created by reverse-engineering the UML diagrams and documentation from the
        original CDB submission  as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One
        of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model
        that is consistent with the other OGC standards and to identify functional
        gaps between the current CDB data store and the OGC standards baseline.  This
        document references sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and

        use by simulation clients. From the geospatial community perspective, these

        document proposes a set of best practices and guidelines for implementing
        and using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) to serve
        maps which are members of an ensemble of maps, each of which is a valid possible
        alternative for the same time and location. In the meteorological and oceanographic
        communities, it is Best Practice to produce a large number of simultaneous
        forecasts, whether for a short range of hours, a few days, seasonal or climatological
        predictions. These ensembles of forecasts indicate the probability distributions
        of specific outcomes. This document describes how to unambiguously specify

        are the key technology for locating, managing and maintaining\r\ndistributed
        geo-resources (i.e. geospatial data, applications and services). With OGC\r\ncatalogue
        services, client applications are capable of searching for geo-resources in
        a\r\nstandardized way (i.e. through standardized interfaces and operations)
        and, ideally, they\r\nare based on a well-known information model, which includes
        spatial references and\r\nfurther descriptive (thematic) information that
        enables client applications to search for\r\ngeo-resources in very efficient
        ways.\r\nWhereas interfaces and operations of OGC catalogue services are well
        defined, it is left\r\nup to the developer of the system to define a specific
        information model which a\r\ncatalogue service instance provides. This includes,
        but is not limited to, the information\r\nwhich can be inserted in the catalog,
        supported query languages, available search terms,\r\nresponse\/result sets,
        etc. This point is of major importance with respect to interoperability\r\nbetween
        different catalogue service instances.\r\nIn Europe, running catalogue instances
        result from work being done within different SDI\r\ninitiatives (e.g. SDI
        NRW Initiative1, Germany\/Netherlands cross-border initiative, JRC\r\nEU Portal,
        EUROSTAT, Inspire, German SDI initiative). Members of these initiatives\r\nhave
        developed an ISO-based application profile for ISO19115 metadata for\r\ngeodata\/geospatial
        applications and ISO19119-based metadata for tightly and looselycoupled\r\ngeospatial
        services. The foundations of this profile were the OGC catalogue\r\nspecification
        (1.1.1), the OGC Web Registry Server (WRS) 0.0.2, OGC Web Services\r\nStateless
        Catalogue Profile (StCS) 0.0.6 and ISO 19115\/19119 for content description.\r\nOGC''s
        catalogue revision working group (CS-RWG) has revised and integrated the\r\ncatalogue
        implementation specification v1.1.1 that have resulted in CS 2.0.2. One part
        of\r\nthis OGC specification comprises the definition of application profiles
        according to ISO\r\n19106 (Geographic information \u2013 Profiles). The overall
        goal of these profiles is to\r\nimprove interoperability between systems conforming
        to a specific profile. Experience\r\nhas shown that the need for application
        profiles results from the fact that in practice, there\r\nis no single solution
        for catalogue services that fits every user\u2019s needs. As stated in CS\r\n2.0.2,
        a base profile that provides a basic set of information objects has to be
        supported\r\nby each catalogue instance; in addition, application profiles
        for different information\r\ncommunities can be specified.\r\nHence, this
        document specifies an application profile for ISO 19115:2003\/ISO\r\n19119:2005
        metadata with support for XML encoding per ISO\/TS19139:2007 [ISO\/TS19139]2
        and HTTP protocol binding. It relies on requirements coming from the\r\nCS\/CSW
        2.0 specification (OGC CS 2.0.2, OGC document 07-006). The application\r\nprofile
        will form the basis of conformance tests and reference implementations.","publisher":"Open

        ER [5] to capture status quo, discussions, and results in the context of requirements
        for data quality assessment for Quality of Service in the Aviation Domain.
        It will, in particular, provide a Data Quality Assessment Service Specification.
        Much of the ER is presented in the future tense, using terms such as ''shall'',
        in order to express requirements and constraints on future Data Quality Assessment
        Service implementations. The service specification includes design patterns,
        extension mechanisms, and service interface considerations.\r\n\r\nIn recent
        years, the concept of data quality has generated a notable interest among
        System Wide Information Management (SWIM) [17] implementers, both organization-specific
        and global. In the context of SWIM \u2014 and Service Oriented Architecture
        (SOA) implementations in general \u2014 data quality pertains to two major
        use cases, service advertising and service validation:\r\n\r\nService advertising\r\na
        service makes known to a potential consumer the quality of the data provided
        by the service. Based on this information, the consumer can determine whether
        or not the service meets its needs.\r\n\r\nService validation\r\nassurance
        is given that the quality of the data provided by a service is consistent
        with the quality that is explicitly defined in a service contract or any kind
        of agreement that may exist between a service provider and service consumer.\r\n\r\nBoth
        use cases share two common preconditions:\r\n\r\nAn unambiguous definition
        of the concept of data quality exists.\r\n\r\nA set of measurable parameters
        that allow specifying data quality is defined.\r\n\r\nThese are tasks that

        For example, among those in the law enforcement, fire and rescue community,
        various local, national and international agencies use different symbols and

        System Wide Information Management (SWIM) enabled services in particular -
        is the ability of a service to be discovered. The ability of a service to
        be discovered is assured by providing a uniformly interpretable set of service
        metadata that can be accessed by a service consumer through a retrieval mechanism
        (e.g., a service registry). Such a set of metadata (commonly referred to as
        a service description) has been defined by Federal Aviation Administration
        (FAA) and European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL)
        and formalized in a Service Description Conceptual Model (SDCM) [SDCM].\r\n\r\nThe
        SDCM is currently used in standard service description documents and service
        registries by both FAA and EUROCONTROL. As part of the effort of enhancing
        service discovery, both organizations also use a number of categories that
        can be associated with all services and are generally referred to as taxonomies.
        The current set of taxonomies used by both EUROCONTROL and FAA categorizes
        (i.e., meta tags) services based on their availability status, interface model,
        data product, etc. However, despite the increasing role of OGC services in
        the SWIM environment, no taxonomies for categorizing services based on geographical
        coverage or other geospatial characteristics have been defined. This ER documents

        of MapML is to define a hypermedia type for geospatial maps on the web that
        can be embedded in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages. MapML is needed
        because while Web browsers implement HTML and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG),
        including the <map> element, those implementations do not meet the requirements
        of the broader Web mapping community. The semantics of the HTML map element
        are incomplete or insufficient relative to modern Web maps and mapping in
        general. Currently, robust web maps are implemented by a variety of non-standard
        technologies. Web maps do not work without script support, making their creation
        a job beyond the realm of beginners'' skill sets. In order to improve collaboration
        and integration of the mapping and Web communities, it is desirable to enhance
        or augment the functionality of the <map> element in HTML to include the accessible
        user interface functions of modern web maps (e.g. panning, zooming, searching
        for, and zooming to, styling, identifying features\u2019 properties, etc.),
        while maintaining a simple, declarative, accessible interface for HTML authors.\r\n\r\nThe
        objective of this Engineering Report is to explore how MapML can be harmonized
        with the OGC standards mainstream and contribute to the progress of the specification
        avoiding unnecessary duplication. In particular, the ER proposes Web Map Service
        (WMS) or Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) as services that can be used to deliver
        MapML documents with small modifications.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration on

        features by defining fundamental relationships among various components of
        the hydrosphere. This includes relationships such as hierarchies of catchments,
        segmentation of rivers and lakes, and the hydrologically determined topological
        connectivity of features such as catchments and waterbodies. The standard

        City Pilot Phase 1 (FCP1) is an OGC Interoperability Program initiative in
        collaboration with buildingSMART International (bSI). The pilot aimed at demonstrating
        and enhancing the ability of spatial data infrastructures to support quality
        of life, civic initiatives, and urban resilience. During the pilot, multiple
        scenarios were set up based on real-world requirements and were put forward
        by the pilot sponsors: Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s (Barcelona, Spain), Ordnance
        Survey Great Britain (UK), virtualcitySYSTEMS GmbH (Germany), and Institut
        National de l\u2019Information G\u00e9ographique et Foresti\u00e8re - IGN
        (France). The scenarios were focused on (i) the interoperability between the
        two international standards: Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML;
        (ii) city flood modeling; and (iii) supporting real-time sensor readings and
        other time-dependent properties within semantic 3D city models. The solutions
        for the respective scenarios were developed by the pilot participants: University
        of Melbourne (Australia), Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc. (U.S.A), and Technical
        University of Munich (Germany). This Engineering Report (ER) focuses on the
        third scenario requiring the support of real-time sensors and other time-dependent
        properties within semantic 3D city models based on the CityGML standard. It
        highlights a new concept ''Dynamizer'', which allows representation of highly
        dynamic data in different and generic ways and providing a method for injecting
        dynamic variations of city object properties into the static representations.
        It also establishes explicit links between sensor\/observation data and the
        respective properties of city model objects that are measured by them. The
        Dynamizer concept has been implemented as an Application Domain Extension
        (ADE) of the CityGML standard. This implementation allows to use new dynamizer
        features with the current version of the CityGML standard (CityGML 2.0). The
        advantage with this approach is that it allows for selected properties of
        city models to become dynamic without changing the original CityGML data model.
        If an application does not support dynamic data, it simply does not allow\/include
        these special types of features. The details and results of the pilot are

        FAA service classification taxonomies and elaborates the interoperability
        between ontology based WSDOM and OWS compatible service descriptions.","publisher":"Open

        engineering report capture the work to extend the existing Web Coverage Service
        (WCS) profiles, particularly the Earth Observation Application Profile (EO-WCS
        [OGC 10-140r1]) to support multi-dimensional subsetting of 3D space and 1D
        time. The updated EO-WCS (EO-WCS1.1 [OGC 10-140r2]) have removed the requirement
        for the 2D coverages so that it can explicitly allow coverages with more dimensions
        as long as they have geographic footprint. Furthermore it also clarified the
        use of rangeType when non-NCNAME characters are present in a band identifier.
        The example of GetCapabilites, DescribeEOCoverageSet, and _GetCoverage request
        in the updated EO-WCS1.1 is shown with use case on fire emission data in San
        Francisco.\r\n\r\nFollowing the recommendation for EO-WCS to fully embrace
        the N-D, multi-dimensional, concept of Coverages as a function of time and
        other coordinates alongside the geospatial ones, the proposed recommendations\/changes
        in the extension for WCS DescribeCoverage, EO-WCS DescribeEOCoverageSet, and
        WCS GetCoverage are discussed with use case example using National Centers
        for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global 0.25 deg wind data. Based on the
        mutual recommendation from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) and Baart et. al (2012), Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) was the
        output format due to presence of its libraries in multiple languages to lower
        the burden in changing on developers of WCS-compliant servers and clients.\r\n\r\nFor
        the extension of the WCS DescribeCoverage, it is recommended that CIS1.1 should
        be considered adopting a scheme for transmitting coordinates similar to the
        _cis:rangeSet where data are referred to as an attached Multipurpose Internet
        Mail Extensions (MIME) part. Time, as much as possible, be treated as just
        another coordinates dimension so that it could be access with the same tools
        used for other coordinate dimensions. To tackle the issue on order of coordinate
        dimensions, it is recommended to add implementation note to the EO-WCS specifications
        so that implementers are aware of the mismatches between dataset coordinate
        reference systems (CRSs) and actual axis order.\r\n\r\nFor the extension of
        EO_WCS DescribeEOCoverageSet, the issue on missing range of results API needed
        to be resolved by adding a request mechanism for requesting a range of matching
        results. It is also recommended that DescribeEOCoverageSet activity might
        be of more use to the client if the client need to supply only the subset
        conditions, and not a list of identifiers.\r\n\r\nFor the extension of WCS
        GetCoverage, it was discovered that for the GetCoverage operation for higher
        dimensioned datasets, existing WCS-2.0 request interface provided adequate
        syntax for subsetting higher dimensional data. Scaling (re-gridding) operation
        appears to be a natural fit for the EO-WCS subsetting, specifically SCALEEXTENT
        activity, however simpler explanation might be needed to fully understand
        its use as it appears other scaling and subsetting commands may be more than
        adequate for the desired outcomes. Additionally allowing SlicePoint subsetting
        is also recommended.\r\n\r\nAfter performing the testing in the client side,
        there were few potential recommendations for improvements. More information
        on whether the coverage is 2D or 3D form the GetCapalilites request might
        be helpful to client so it can limit the number of DescribeCoverage requests
        to construct a list of available coverage on the server. Furthermore additional
        metadata information for displaying meaningful native gird coordinates is
        also recommended for clarification. Finally automatic detection of lat\/lon
        axes along with clear treatment of XY and lat\/lon axes ordering would be
        an improvement in the existing operations.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2017-04-28","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"332":{"title":"Testbed-12

        12 Engineering Report discusses the topic of vector tiling.\r\n\r\nWhile tiling
        and the use of multiple levels of details are a proven technique for raster
        data, it is relatively new for vector data. This is due to the increased complexity
        for tiling vector data compared to raster tiling. Further, there is a lack
        of standardization on the topic. Yet vector tiles can provide the same benefits
        as for raster tiles:\r\n\r\nServices can easily cache tiles and return them
        upon request, without the need for any additional pre\/post processing (assuming
        no geometry construction is needed in the server). Consequently, clients can
        request and receive tiles quickly, ensuring better user experience.\r\n\r\nDue
        to tiled, multileveled data representations, clients can better access the
        data most suitable for their current map location and scale. This avoids the
        need to load too much data, which can cause both excessive memory usage and
        network traffic resulting in reduced overall performance.\r\n\r\nAn example
        of vector tiling that illustrates the impact of these benefits is the OpenStreetMap
        (OSM) data store, which includes over 30 GB of data with worldwide coverage
        consisting of millions of vector features. Loading and visualizing all the
        OSM data into an application would either result in a memory shortage or unacceptable
        performance. By means of vector tiling and the generation of multiple levels
        of detail, apps using OSM data can load such data sets very efficiently into
        applications.\r\n\r\nThis Engineering Report (ER) focuses on the general aspects
        of vector tiling. One of the main goals is to characterize what vector tiling
        is and how it can be approached. Highlighted topics include tiling approaches
        and strategies, tiling schemes, data coherence, simplification, scalability
        and styling. With respect to tiling schemes, existing standards material related
        to raster tiling schemes is incorporated to align both topics and to maximize
        interoperability. This includes the Defence Geospatial Information Working
        Group (DGIWG) Web Map Tiling Standard (WMTS) profile and the National System
        for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) WMTS profile as defined by the U.S. National
        Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).\r\n\r\nThe topic of implementing vector
        tiles using a tile encoding \/ storage format is not covered. A study of implementing
        vector tiles in OGC GeoPackage is part of a separate Engineering Report, OGC
        16-067, that builds on the results of this ER.\r\n\r\n","publisher":"Open

        The OWS Context JSON enconding is based on the GeoJSON IETF standard [RFC7946].
        The standard is a combination of two approaches:\r\n\r\nmapping between the
        OWS Context conceptual model [12-080r2] to the basic structure of a GeoJSON
        file.\r\n\r\na direct conversion of the rest of the atom keys and the specific

        It is widely known that HTML was designed with the linking capacity in mind.
        Both, users reading HTML and automatic crawlers, transverse links constantly.
        HTML seems the natural selection for linking geospatial data on the web. The
        question is how to complement the linking mechanism with some additional metadata
        that search engines could use for indexing. A solution could come from a mechanism
        which web search engines already have agreed to use for better indexing: schema.org.\r\n\r\nSchemna.org
        proposes three enconding for their data model: Microdata, RDFa and JSON-LD.
        The reader might easily get confused by the fact that OGC approved a JSON
        encoding for OWS context and another JSON encoding emerges in this document.
        This ER is NOT proposing to replace or modify the currently approved JSON
        enconding for OWS context based on GeoJSON. The intention is to map the OWS
        Context model into the schema.org model to recognize that they are very similar
        and propose a encoding in HTML5 that can be done in the 3 alternative proposed
        by schema.org.\r\n\r\n","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2017-06-16","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"335":{"title":"Testbed-12

        in an OGC GeoPackage. This report builds on the general topic of vector tiling
        discussed in OGC Testbed 12 Engineering Report [OGC 16-068r4].\r\n\r\nSince
        its public release in 2012, OGC GeoPackage has been getting increasingly popular
        within the geospatial industry for a variety of use cases, such as a means
        to package geospatial data for use on a mobile device and as a means to exchange
        geospatial data between two systems.\r\n\r\nThe OGC GeoPackage standard currently
        specifies requirements (rules) for storing raster tiles and vector (simple)
        features. This Engineering Report proposes an extension to the supported data
        types by introducing an implementation for vector tiles.\r\n\r\nWhile tiling
        and the use of multiple levels of details are a proven technique for accessing
        and visualizing raster data, it is less commonly applied for vector data.
        This is due to the increased complexity compared to raster tiling and lack

        tiles and return them instantly upon request, without the need for any additional
        pre\/post processing. Consequently, clients can get tiles very fast, ensuring
        fast and responsive maps.\r\n\r\nUsing tiled, multileveled data representations,
        clients can always access the data most suitable for their current map location
        and scale. This avoids the need to load too much data, which can cause excessive
        memory usage and reduce overall performance.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to enable

        in an efficient way, similar to raster tiles.\r\n\r\n","publisher":"Open Geospatial

        is a deliverable of the OGC Testbed-12. It describes the results of analyzing
        the Testbed-12 web service implementations.\r\n\r\nOGC has been developing
        web service specifications since the OGC Web Mapping Testbed in 1999. In particular,
        the original OGC Web Map Service specification has been developed during that
        testbed. 17 years later most current OGC web service standards still follow
        the general approach that had been developed in 1999 (the capabilities document,
        the remote procedure call via HTTP paradigm, etc).\r\n\r\nOver time, the OGC
        web service approach has been amended and extended in different ways by different
        OGC standards and profiles. In addition, some of the more flexible mechanisms
        have been used in practice in different ways by different software vendors
        or communities. The OGC Web Service Common standard had been a response by
        OGC to these developments and aimed at maintaining a consistent approach across
        the different OGC web service standards. However, this effort has been only
        partially successful for several reasons, including shortcomings in the OWS
        Common standard, the existence of multiple incompatible OWS Common versions
        and a reluctance by working groups and communities to introduce incompatible
        changes to existing service types in order to harmonize. All attempts in recent
        years to continue the work on OWS Common have not seen much traction. While
        there seems to be general agreement that the current situation is not optimal
        and that consistency is desirable, it is unclear how to improve in a way that
        meets market demands.\r\n\r\nThis document summarizes information about the
        web service implementations in Testbed-12. It is not and should not be understood
        as a general analysis or assessment of the OGC web service architecture, but
        a low-key effort to gain some insights from looking at a significant number
        of web service implementations and their use in interoperability experiments
        and demos.\r\n\r\nDuring the years since 1999 not only the OGC standards baseline
        has evolved, but also the Web itself. The W3C has been working on identifying
        Best Practices for Data on the Web and W3C and OGC are jointly working on
        extending this with Best Practices for Spatial Data on the Web. The analysis
        also includes an assessment about the OGC approach to web services with respect
        to the draft best practices at the time of writing of this report.\r\n\r\nTo
        the extent possible, we draw conclusions and recommendations from the information
        that has been gathered. These fall into three categories:\r\n\r\nImproving
        the interoperability of OGC web services as they are today\r\n\r\nSupport

        OWS Context Document standard (OWS Context) was created to allow a set of

        as a collection of services (but also potentially in-line content). The objective
        is to support use cases such as the distribution of search results, the exchange
        of a set of resources in a Common Operating Picture (COP), or delivery of
        a set of configured processing services to allow the processing to be reproduced
        on different processing nodes.\r\nThe goal for OWS Context is to replace previous
        OGC standards and best practices that provide similar capability. Web Map
        Context (WMC) has been reasonably successful but is limited to working with
        only Web Map Service (WMS) instances. Other work on the Location Organizer

        encoding standards for OWS Context. The OGC Standards Working Group (SWG)

        each encoding format will be described in a separate OGC Extension to the

        data are defined in ISO 19141:2008 (Geographic information - Schema for moving

        (Peter) A. Vretanos","contributor":null,"description":"For many years OGC
        has been developing a suite of standards defining web services interfaces
        and encodings for geospatial processing. The suite includes a Web Map Service
        (WMS), a Web Map Tiling Service (WMTS), a Web Feature Service (WFS), a Web
        Coverage Service (WCS), a Web Catalogue Service (CSW), the Sensor Web (SWE)
        suite of services, etc. These service interfaces and their implementations
        have, more or less, been developed independently of one another resulting
        in isolation and poor integration between them. For example, consider a map
        generated by a WMS. A client or user cannot easily determine which source
        data was used to create the map and how to download that source data though
        an OGC data service such as WFS or WCS. Furthermore when one considers the
        Publish-Find-Bind paradigm, OGC can only partially support the full potential
        of this paradigm. This is because OGC structured catalogues can only register
        services in isolation of other related services and cannot automatically determine
        the relationships among services and the resources they offer.\r\n\r\nIn order
        to achieve better integration between OGC web services and enhance the publish-find-bind
        paradigm, this OGC Engineering Report defines and discusses three key elements.
        These are:\r\n\r\nDefining a new service, called the Web Integration Service
        (WIS), which allows for the discovery and access to integrated sets of OGC
        web services deployed at an endpoint.\r\n\r\nSpecifying a means of discovering
        and describing associations between web resources (both OGC and non-OGC).\r\n\r\nDefining
        extensions to the OGC catalogue to allow the service to harvest and make discoverable
        a rich set of linked OGC and non-OGC resources.\r\n\r\nThe Web Integration
        Service (WIS) is an aggregation service whose only purpose is to provide a
        list of references to a suite of other, perhaps related OGC services available
        at an endpoint.\r\n\r\nA new operation, named GetAssociations, is defined
        as an extension such that existing OGC services (WMS, WFS, WCS, etc.) may
        implement this operation in order to support rich auto-discovery. This operation
        enables OGC web services to externalize their internal association knowledge
        about their content and relationships to other OGC and external resources.
        For example, a WMS would know if the source data for a layer it offers is
        a Shapefile, or a WFS feature type, or another WMS layer (i.e. cascading),
        or if a WMTS layer exists that renders the same information more efficiently.
        This internal knowledge can now be externalized via the GetAssociations operation.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
        OGC Catalogues Service instances can harvest the capabilities document of
        an OGC web service, register that service, register the existence of the individual
        offerings that the service offers and also register the association between
        the service and the content it offers. Thus, the entire harvesting process
        is focused on a single OGC web service and consequently offers a limited scope
        of discovery. In order to support rich discovery, a catalogue needs to be
        able to automatically register services found at an endpoint as well as register
        all known associations among those services, their offerings and other OGC
        and non-OGC resources. This involves harvesting a service\u2019s capabilities
        document to determine what content the service offers but it also involves
        further interrogating the service to determine of what (if any) other associations
        it is aware. Populated with this enhanced knowledge a client may now use a
        catalogue to, for example, find the description of feature data and then be
        able to find the WFS that offer that data, a WMS that renders those features
        into a map, a WMTS that has a tiled representation of that data, etc. In order
        to support this kind of rich discovery, a new CSW-ebRIM package is specified
        that defines ebRIM object types, associations, classifications and stored
        queries that support the description of integrated OGC web service and their
        artifacts within the catalogue.","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2017-03-10","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":"text\/html","hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"366":{"title":"Testbed-12

        be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators,

        process that is performed on-demand in real-time.\r\nThe application of CDB
        to future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source

        created within a single computer or a vast distributed network connected by
        local and wide area networks and augmented by super-realistic special effects
        and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization of and immersion into
        the environment being simulated . \r\nThis standard defines the organization

        simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry.
        A series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines
        for data representation of real world features.\r\nThe CDB synthetic environment
        is a representation of the natural environment including external features
        such as man-made structures and systems.  A CDB data store can include terrain
        relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made
        cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the
        ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean
        floor.  In addition, the data store can includes the specific attributes of
        the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.\r\nThe associated
        CDB Standard Best Practice documents provide a description of a data schema
        for Synthetic Environmental information (i.e. it merely describes data) for
        use in simulation.  The CDB Standard provides a rigorous definition of the

        (industry-standard) formats.\r\nA CDB conformant data store contains datasets
        organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail. Together, these datasets
        represent the features of a synthetic environment for the purposes of distributed

        OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and Measurements
        (ISO 19156:2010 and OGC 10-025r1) for describing Earth Observation products
        (EO products).\r\nThis profile is intended to provide a standard schema for
        encoding Earth Observation product metadata to support the description and
        cataloguing of products from sensors aboard EO satellites.  \r\nThe metadata
        being defined in this document is applicable in a number of places where EO
        product metadata is needed.\r\n1.\tIn the EO Product Extension Package for
        ebRIM (OGC 10-189). This extension package defines how to catalog Earth Observation
        product metadata described by this document. Using this metadata model and
        the Catalogue Service defined in OGC 10-189, client applications can provide
        the functionality to discover EO Products.  Providing an efficient encoding
        for EO Product metadata cataloguing and discovery is the prime purpose of
        this specification.\r\n2.\tIn the EO Application Profile of WMS (OGC 07-063r1).
        The GetFeatureInfo operation on the outline (footprint layer) should return
        metadata following the Earth Observation Metadata profile of Observation and
        Measurements.\r\n3.\tIn a coverage downloaded via an EO WCS AP (OGC 10-140).
        In WCS 2.0 (OGC 10-084), the GetCoverage and DescribeCoverage response contains
        the metadata element intended to store metadata information about the coverage.
        The Earth Observation Application profile of WCS (OGC 10-140) specifies that
        the metadata format preferred for Earth Observation is defined by this document.\r\n4.\tPotentially
        enclosed within an actual product to describe georeferencing information as
        for instance within the JPEG2000 format using GMLJP2. GMLJP2 defines how to
        store GML coverage metadata inside a JP2 file.  \r\nEarth Observation data
        products are generally managed within logical collections that are usually
        structured to contain data items derived from sensors onboard a satellite
        or series of satellites.  The key characteristics differentiating products
        within the collections are date of acquisition, location as well as characteristics
        depending on the type of sensor, For example, key characteristics for optical
        imagery are the possible presence of cloud, haze, smokes or other atmospheric
        or on ground phenomena obscuring the image. \r\nThe common metadata used to
        distinguish EO products types are presented in this document for generic and
        thematic EO products (i.e optical, radar, atmospheric, altimetry, limb-looking
        and synthesis and systematic products). From these metadata the encodings
        are derived according to standard schemas. In addition, this document describes
        the mechanism used to extend these schemas to specific missions and for specific
        purposes such as long term data preservation. \r\n","publisher":"Open Geospatial

        environments. A number of OGC Web service interfaces support SOAP bindings
        (see chapter 6). Unfortunately, those bindings are not fully consistent across
        the suite of OGC service standards. Differences can be found in terms of SOAP
        versions, used namespaces, error handling, capabilities documentation, or

        working group. \r\nThis document seeks to provide an overview of the current

        A number of change requests have been developed during the development process

        8, it is highly recommended to either form a new SOAP working group, or preferably
        to assign the development of SOAP best practices to reduce the risk of missed
        requirements and architecture arguments to the newly reformed OWS Common SWG.

        operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine its capabilities

        the service offers.\r\n\r\nQuery operations allow features or values of feature
        properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon constraints,

        exclusive access to features for the purpose of modifying or deleting features.\r\n\r\nTransaction

        support for open searches and federated distributed searches in current distributed
        computing paradigms. We also evaluated the support of semantic searches using
        different strategies, including (1) semantic mediation, a.k.a. ontology-based
        query expansion (Li et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011), (2) semantic association,
        which enables current catalogue information models to support semantic search
        (Li et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015), and (3) complete renovation of the CSW information
        model to be a triple store and utilize Semantic Web technology (Berner-Lee
        2001) to support semantic query and data retrieval. Scenarios to search for
        hydrological data are developed to evaluate the performance of catalogue searching

        years there has been an increase in the number, size and complexity of databases

        across static and deployed networks. Linked Data has been suggested as a method
        able to tackle those challenges. The aim of the Hydrographic Linked Data activity

        data by building on the achievements of the previous testbeds and to improve
        the understanding of how to better build relations between hydro features
        and non-hydro features (e.g., stream gauge measurement\/location vs bridge
        or other built features upstream or downstream). This aspect of the testbed

        CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including
        external features such as man-made structures and systems.  It encompasses
        the terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural
        and man-made cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface,
        and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the
        ocean floor.  In addition, the synthetic environment includes the specific
        attributes of the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.\r\nA
        CDB contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail; together,
        these datasets represent the features of a synthetic environment for the purposes
        of distributed simulation applications.  The organization of the synthetic
        environmental data in a CDB is specifically tailored for real-time applications.

        with REST for service encoding. This affects not only the way the service
        is implemented but also the way the standard is presented and described. In
        fact, basing the standard on REST implies that the service has to be described
        in terms of resources and methods applied on them whilst in SOAP services,

        is structured in Web Service operations.\r\n\u2022\tUsage of OpenSearch Description
        Documents as an alternate method for describing sensors and tasking Options

        method for describing sensors and tasking options within OpenSearch Description

        the Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) is to enable the runtime exchange of
        data between process simulation models and also between models and other modelling
        tools such as databases and analytical and visualization applications. Its
        creation has been driven by the need to understand how processes interact
        and to predict the likely outcomes of those interactions under given conditions.
        A key design aim has been to bring about interoperability between independently
        developed modelling components, where those components may originate from
        any discipline or supplier. The ultimate aim is to transform integrated modelling
        into an operational tool accessible to all and so open up the potential opportunities
        created by integrated modelling for innovation and wealth creation. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis
        document defines the requirements that a component must meet to achieve OpenMI
        compliance. These comprise: 1) a very thin core set of requirements covering
        the information and functions needed to establish a link and make an exchange
        between two components and 2) a set of optional extensions for handling more
        complex situations. The document does not describe how to implement the standard.

        Service (WCS) and others in a \u2018common operating picture\u2019. Additionally
        OWS Context can deliver a set of configured processing services (Web Processing
        Service (WPS)) parameters to allow the processing to be reproduced on different
        nodes.\r\nOWS Context is aimed at replacing previous OGC attempts at providing
        such a capability (the Web Map Context WMC) which was reasonably successful
        but limited to WMS. Other work on the \u2018Location Organizer Folder (LOF)\u2019
        was also taken into consideration. The concept of OWS Context, and the first
        prototype document was produced as part of OGC testbed OWS-7. See OGC 10-035r1,
        Information Sharing Engineering Report. In order to achieve mass market appeal,
        as well as being useful to a wider community, the use of OWS Context support
        to other existing standards was considered. Multiple encoding formats for
        OWS Context have been developed (ATOM, JSON). Each of these is described in
        a separate OWS Context Extensions to the Core model.\r\nThis document concentrates
        on describing the OWS Context Model in abstract terms using UML. The document
        defines requirements and use cases. It also includes an abstract test suite
        to verify that encodings are compliant with the core specification. The intent
        of OWS Context is to allow many types of OGC Data Delivery service to be referenced
        and therefore exploited (for example, not just WMS but also WFS, WCS and WPS)
        but it does not explicitly define the encoding of these services in the core
        (only the general approach to be used for different types of service interface).
        Service explicit encodings are defined within the extension documents for
        ATOM and JSON.\r\nThe abbreviation owc is used throughout this document for
        OWS Context.\r\n","publisher":"Open Geospatial Consortium","language":"English","license":null,"source":null,"rights":"","isPartOf":null,"date":"2014-01-22","dateAccepted":null,"dateSubmitted":null,"format":null,"hasFormat":null,"extent":null},"549":{"title":"OGC

        (ISE), homeland security (HLS), homeland defense (HLD), law enforcement (LE),
        emergency management (EM) and public safety missions in the US.  The inability
        to transport, deliver and exchange geospatial information for critical geospatial
        assets increases the risk to the nation.\r\nMany ISE HLS\/HDS\/LE mission
        partners have developed stand-alone geospatial information systems (GIS) or
        Common Operating Picture (COP) applications to support their stakeholder communities
        during incidents and for daily operational support. While different missions,
        these GIS\/COP capabilities rely upon much of the same data or generate specific
        data during an event.  The data are often stove-piped and not exposed to a
        broader community that could benefit from these data, resulting in duplication
        and delayed or incorrect decisions. While mission partners do not need to
        use the same GIS\/COP tools, they could benefit from shared access to the
        common operating data and services used within these systems if they were

        \r\n\r\nThe OpenGIS\u00ae Transducer Markup Language Encoding Standard (TML)
        is an application and presentation layer communication protocol for exchanging
        live streaming or archived data to (i.e. control data) and\/or sensor data
        from any sensor system. A sensor system can be one or more sensors, receivers,
        actuators, transmitters, and processes. A TML client can be capable of handling
        any TML enabled sensor system without prior knowledge of that system.\r\n
        \r\nThe protocol contains descriptions of both the sensor data and the sensor
        system itself. It is scalable, consistent, unambiguous, and usable with any
        sensor system incorporating any number sensors and actuators. It supports
        the precise spatial and temporal alignment of each data element. It also supports
        the registration, discovery and understanding of sensor systems and data,
        enabling users to ignore irrelevant data. It can adapt to highly dynamic and
        distributed environments in distributed net-centric operations.\r\n \r\nThe
        sensor system descriptions use common models and metadata and they describe
        the physical and semantic relationships of components, thus enabling sensor
        fusion.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http:\/\/www.opengeospatial.org\/ogc\/markets-technologies\/swe]
